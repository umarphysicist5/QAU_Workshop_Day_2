# Session 1 No-code Automation
## Automated TXT File Processing Pipeline with n8n  
*(Google Drive → Google Sheets → Gmail)*

### 📌 Overview
This project provides an **n8n Cloud workflow** that automates the processing of short text documents.  
The workflow:  
1. Watches a Google Drive folder for new `.txt` files  
2. Downloads the files and extracts key keywords/phrases  
3. Appends the results (filename, text, keywords) to a Google Sheet  
4. Sends a summary email via Gmail with extracted data  

A simple, reusable pipeline for lightweight document automation.

### ⚡ Features
- Automated ingestion of `.txt` files from Google Drive  
- Customizable keyword extraction logic (Regex in Code node)  
- Google Sheets integration for structured storage  
- Gmail summary reports for quick insights  
- Runs fully in **n8n Cloud** (no servers required)

# Session 2 Rapid Prototyping

Create a Python script that generates assignments and quizzes based on a provided document or topic. 
-The script should accept input text (document or topic) and output 2 assignment questions (e.g., essay prompts) and 3 multiple-choice quiz questions with options and answers. 
-Use simple logic to parse the input (e.g., split by sentences or keywords) and print the results. 
-Add Streamlit for the frontend.
